# MITRE ATT&CK Analysis Repository

## Purpose
This repository contains structured analyses of real-world cyber incidents and adversary behavior using the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. The focus is on analytical reasoning, evidence-based mapping of tactics and techniques, and defensive implications derived from open-source information.

## Scope
The analyses in this repository prioritize:
- **Open-source reporting** and publicly available data.
- **Behavioral mapping** over tool-centric descriptions.
- **Defensive and detection-oriented** perspectives.

This repository focuses on the analytical mapping process and does not provide production-ready SIEM rules or enterprise detection environments.

## Methodology
Each case study follows a consistent analytical workflow:
1. **Incident Selection:** Selection of activity based on credible public sources.
2. **Source Evaluation:** Cross-referencing reports to ensure data integrity.
3. **ATT&CK Mapping:** Mapping observed behavior to specific tactics and techniques.
4. **Detection Opportunities:** Identification of observables and potential artifacts.
5. **Limitations:** Documentation of analytical gaps or assumptions made.

## Repository Structure
- `methodology/` : Analysis framework, scoring rubrics, and assumptions.
- `case-studies/` : Individual ATT&CK-mapped incident analyses.
- `techniques/` : Focused deep dives into specific ATT&CK techniques.
- `references/` : Catalog of source material and external reports used.

## Intended Audience
This repository is intended for learning, skill development, and demonstration of analytical capability for roles in OSINT, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and cyber defense.

## Ethics & Attribution
All analyses are based strictly on publicly available information. Sources are cited where applicable. No proprietary, sensitive, or non-public data is utilized in these assessments.
