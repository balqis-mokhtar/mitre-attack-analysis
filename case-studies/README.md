# Case Studies

Each case study is a structured analysis of a real-world cyber incident, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## How to read a case study

Each folder follows this structure:

- `overview.md` — What happened, who was involved, and why it matters
- `attack-flow.md` — Step-by-step walkthrough of how the attack unfolded
- `attck-mapping.md` — Each attack step mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
- `detection-considerations.md` — What signals defenders could have used to catch this
- `limitations.md` — Gaps in the analysis and assumptions made
