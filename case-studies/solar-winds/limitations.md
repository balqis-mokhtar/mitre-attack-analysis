# Limitations — SolarWinds (SUNBURST)

Gaps and assumptions in this analysis.

---

## Initial access to SolarWinds is unclear

How APT29 first got into SolarWinds' network has never been fully disclosed. This means Stage 0 of the attack flow is incomplete — we know it happened, but not exactly how.

## Not all victims are known

18,000+ organizations installed the update, but only a smaller number were confirmed breached. The full list of compromised organizations has not been made public.

## Exfiltrated data is not fully documented

What was actually stolen varies by victim and most of it has not been publicly disclosed. This analysis can only cover what has been reported (e.g. FireEye's red team tools, some government communications).

## Analysis relies on public reporting

Everything here is based on public sources — FireEye, Microsoft, CISA, Symantec, CrowdStrike. The actual scope of the attack is likely larger than what has been reported.

## Timeline has gaps

Some dates are approximate. The exact timing of when APT29 activated SUNBURST on specific networks is not always known from public sources.
